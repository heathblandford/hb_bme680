# hb_bme680 - Indoor Air Sensor Streaming

### Wtf am I doing?
* Primarily using the pirmoroni bme680 examples code for indoor air quality. 
* Importing smtp for emailing myself when temp & air quality get out of bounds
* ~~Streaming data to a power bi interface for easy viewing outside of home network~~
  * just kidding... need a work or school email to get power bi for free LOL
